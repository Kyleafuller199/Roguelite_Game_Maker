# Roguelite Game Maker

**Senior Software Engineering Project – CS 461 (400), Fall 2025**

## Overview
Roguelite Game Maker is a **web-based creation tool** designed to enable aspiring game creators to make, test, and share roguelite-style games without writing code. The tool will provide an intuitive visual editor where creators can define characters, cards, relics, and enemies, test encounters, and iterate quickly on balance and design.

## Project Goals
- Provide an intuitive, no-code, modular environment for roguelite design.
- Enable fast prototyping and iteration through a Create–Test–Play loop.
- Support both personal and shared project workflows.

## Tech Stack
**Frontend:** React, JavaScript, Figma (for design)  
**Backend:** Django (Python), REST API  
**Database:** TBD (SQL or NoSQL)
**Version Control:** GitHub  
**Hosting:** TBD
